# json-parser

A simple json parser in rust for learning purpose. It is not usable and not totally compliant with the json norm yet.

Need to be done:
- [ ] Decent error messages
- [ ] Float and negative number parsing 
- [ ] Exponent number parsing
- [ ] Escape char parsing

Except this, everything should works fine:tm:.
